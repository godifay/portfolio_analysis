##### Based on the daily and annualized return analysis  , the Berkshire Hathaway is higher than the Global Management , in contrast the beta (senstiven of the portfolio to the S&P 500)  of Global Management LLC is less than the Berkshare Hathaway . factors to decide may depend  on risk tolerance , pools of existing portfolio the firm poses and investment priorites of the firm. My recommendation : eventhough the Berkshare Hathaway yields a higher return than the Global Management LLC, since the Global Management still gives a postive return at the same time less volatile to over all market( S&P 500) , I choose the Global Management portfolio to be part of firms fund.
